ABOUT:
This is just a fun program I created in my free time simply to see if
I could crack a solution to a childhood game of mine.  The puzzle this
program attempts to solve is the classic Milton Bradley game Drive Ya Nuts.
There is a JPG image of the game included.

The program was developed using C++ before I really knew C++ and was learning basic C.
I really only had knowledge of python at the time.  So I self taught myself what I needed
to create this application.

It uses a basic brute force method of guessing a possible solution
and checking to see if it works and repeating until it finds a solution. There
is a random seed that never changes so the program always runs the same.

A powerful consumer cpu will take about 30 minutes to find the solution.  Before hitting 
enter and running the program, take note of the number-labels for each hexigon, as the final output will
only provide those numbers and their positions on the board.
